# Network Upgrade Process - Eth1.0 Specification 

## Description
This provides a general outline process to propose, discuss, and track the progress of EIPs considered for network upgrades to Ethereum Mainnet.

## Process

#### Preconditions for consideration
 - Type of EIP -  Core 
 - Status of EIP - Any status between Draft to Final (ref: EIP process)

#### Proposing an EIP

- If you're an author, and still vetting the idea, please follow the guidelines mentioned in EIP - 1 to formalize your idea into an EIP.
- Once an EIP/Pull request (at EIP GitHub) is created, open a new issue at Eth1.0-specs repo referring "EIP# to be considered for CFI". This can be created at any stage of the EIP process.
- It will be then picked up by the HF coordinators and added as Proposed EIP in the project tracker.
- The author/proposer then adds it to the agenda of the ACD meeting. It is not required to be part of the project tracker to be discussed in an ACD meeting.

#### Socializing an EIP
- Open a discussion thread preferably at the [Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/). Share it in the ACD Discord channel and other channels.
- Show up on the new video series on EIPs ['Peep an EIP'](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/PM/projects/2#column-10491086) to discuss the background, need, and application of the EIP followed by Q&A.
- Invite the author to [Ethereum All core dev meetings](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues) for EIP to be introduced to the client teams.

#### Reviewing an EIP
The author or champion may reach out to EIP Editors or the HF coordinator for help to review the EIP, if not already reviewed. HF coordinator may coordinate with EIP editors based on the interest/availability.

#### Network Upgrade Process Tracker
The tracker is found in the project section of this repository.
